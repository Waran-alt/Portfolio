# Commit Message Guide

This rule helps create consistent, professional commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.

## Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Project Board Integration

### Simple Task ID References
When working on project board tasks, include the task ID for traceability:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description> (#XXX)

# Examples:
chore(tooling): implement husky validation (#001)
fix(deps): move types to devDependencies (#005)
feat(db): add migration system (#011)
```

### ID Format
- **Simple sequential**: [001], [002], [003], etc.
- **Easy reference**: Use #XXX in commits for clean reference
- **Auto-increment**: Always increment from highest existing ID
- **No categorization**: IDs are just for reference, not organization

## Commit Types

### Primary Types
- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Additional Types
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Scope Guidelines

### Frontend Scopes
- **ui**: User interface components
- **styles**: CSS/styling changes
- **components**: React/Vue components
- **pages**: Page-level changes
- **hooks**: Custom hooks
- **utils**: Frontend utilities

### Backend Scopes
- **api**: API endpoints and routes
- **auth**: Authentication and authorization
- **db**: Database related changes
- **models**: Data models and schemas
- **middleware**: Express middleware
- **services**: Business logic services
- **utils**: Backend utilities

### Infrastructure Scopes
- **docker**: Docker configuration
- **nginx**: Nginx configuration
- **ci**: Continuous integration
- **deploy**: Deployment configuration
- **env**: Environment configuration

### General Scopes
- **deps**: Dependencies
- **config**: Configuration files
- **scripts**: Build/utility scripts
- **tests**: Test files
- **docs**: Documentation

## Message Format Rules

### Subject Line (Required)
- **Length**: Maximum 50 characters (including task ID)
- **Capitalization**: Lowercase for type and scope, sentence case for description
- **Punctuation**: No period at the end
- **Imperative mood**: Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")

### Body (Optional)
- **Length**: Wrap at 72 characters
- **Content**: Explain what and why, not how. Keep it concise and focused - avoid exhaustive lists of every change. Summarize the key changes and their purpose.
- **Separation**: Blank line between subject and body

### Footer (Optional)
- **Breaking changes**: Start with "BREAKING CHANGE:"
- **Issues**: Reference issues with "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"
- **Task reference**: Can include task ID here instead of subject line

## Examples

### Good Commit Messages with Task IDs

```
chore(tooling): implement husky validation (#001)

Add commit message validation using Husky and Commitlint
to ensure consistent conventional commit format across
the project.

- Configure pre-commit hooks for linting
- Set up commit-msg validation
- Document commit conventions
```

```
fix(deps): move types to devDependencies (#005)

Move all @types/* packages from dependencies to devDependencies
to reduce production bundle size and improve security.

Affects both frontend and backend package.json files.
```

```
feat(db): add migration system (#011)

Implement proper database migration system with schema
versioning and rollback capability.

- Replace init scripts with migration runner
- Add versioning for schema changes
- Support rollback operations

BREAKING CHANGE: Database initialization now requires
running migrations instead of init scripts.
```

```
refactor(frontend): migrate to monorepo structure (#008)

Move existing frontend code to packages/frontend directory
and update all import paths and build configurations.

Related to monorepo restructuring initiative.
```

### Alternative Footer Reference

```
chore(tooling): implement husky validation

Add commit message validation using Husky and Commitlint
to ensure consistent conventional commit format.

Task: #001
```

### Good Commit Messages (Original Examples)

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh to improve user experience
by reducing the need for manual re-authentication.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): resolve user registration validation error

The email validation was incorrectly rejecting valid addresses
containing plus signs. Updated regex pattern to handle RFC 5322
compliant email addresses.
```

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Add missing environment variable setup steps and clarify
Docker Compose usage for new contributors.
```

```
refactor(ui): extract reusable button component

Move button styles and logic into shared component to reduce
code duplication across pages.
```

### Bad Commit Messages (Avoid)

```
❌ Fixed stuff
❌ Updated files
❌ WIP
❌ asdf
❌ Fix bug in login (no scope, too vague)
❌ FEAT: ADD NEW FEATURE (wrong capitalization)
❌ feat: Added new feature. (wrong mood, has period)
❌ chore: stuff (#001) (too vague, even with task ID)
```

### Simple Changes

For simple, straightforward fixes or changes, keep the commit message concise:

```
fix(frontend): delay cursor following until entrance completes
```

```
style(ui): adjust button padding
```

```
refactor(api): extract validation helper
```

Keep it under 50 characters and focus on what changed, not how or why (unless the why is non-obvious).

## Quick Templates

### Feature Addition with Task ID

```
fix(<scope>): resolve <bug_description> (#XXX)

<explanation of the bug>
<how it was fixed>

Fixes #<issue_number>
```

### Chore/Tooling with Task ID
```
chore(<scope>): <action> <tool/configuration> (#XXX)

## AI Assistant Instructions

When helping with commit messages:

1. **ALWAYS check git status first**: Before any commit, run `git status` to see what's staged vs modified
2. **Analyze staged changes**: Review actual staged files and their diffs (`git diff --staged`) to understand what changed. Write commit messages based on the staged changes, not from memory or assumptions. Act like an external professional reviewing the code changes.
3. **Stage missing changes logically**: If files are modified but not staged, review them and stage them logically. Consider splitting into multiple commits if changes are unrelated.
4. **Identify task ID**: Check if work relates to a project board task (simple #XXX format)
5. **Suggest appropriate type**: Based on the nature of changes observed in the diffs
6. **Recommend scope**: Based on affected files/functionality from the staged changes
7. **Craft clear subject**: Imperative present tense, under 50 characters (including task ID)
8. **Add concise body**: For complex changes, explain what and why, not exhaustive lists. Keep it focused and descriptive without being overly detailed.
9. **Include footers**: For breaking changes or issue references
10. **Validate format**: Ensure compliance with conventional commits
11. **Check spelling**: Ensure professional appearance
12. **Keep it simple**: Use #XXX format for easy reference, not categorization

### **Pre-Commit Checklist**
Before every commit:
```bash
git status  # Check what's staged vs modified
git add .   # Stage any missing changes (if appropriate)
git status  # Verify everything is staged correctly
git commit  # Now safe to commit
```

## Breaking Change Format

For breaking changes, include in footer:
```
BREAKING CHANGE: <description of the breaking change>
<migration instructions if applicable>
```

AND use `!` after type/scope:
```
feat(api)!: change user authentication endpoint (#XXX)

BREAKING CHANGE: The /auth endpoint now requires different parameters.
Update client code to use email instead of username.
```

## Multi-line Message Template with Task ID

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description> (#XXX)

Why this change was needed:
- <reason 1>
- <reason 2>

What was changed:
- <change 1>
- <change 2>

Impact:
- <impact 1>
