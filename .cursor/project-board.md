    - Development ease: env_file for convenience variables
    - Security: Critical secrets explicit in docker-compose
    - Flexibility: Different strategies for dev vs production
    - Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
    
    **Implementation:**
    - ✅ Development: Critical secrets explicit with defaults, convenience vars from .env
    - ✅ Production: All variables explicit, no defaults for security
    - ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml
    - ✅ Enhanced env.example with strategy documentation
    - ✅ Clear categorization: CRITICAL vs CONVENIENCE variables
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Unblocks tasks [005] and [006] for package.json cleanup
    - Maintains security for production deployments
    - Simplifies development setup with sensible defaults
    - Clear documentation for future maintainers

- [013] Define Initial Cursor Rules
  - due: 2025-07-02
  - tags: [tooling, ai-assistance, documentation]
  - priority: low
  - completed: 2025-07-04
    ```md
    Create comprehensive Cursor rules to provide AI context about the
    monorepo structure, coding standards, and project conventions.
    Include rules for different file types and project areas.
    
    Cover: package.json standards, TypeScript config, Docker conventions,
    testing patterns, and documentation requirements.
    
    **STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETED - Created focused, actionable rules:
    - 00-project-overview.mdc (core goals and vision)
    - project-board.mdc (board structure and format)
    - project-board-context.mdc (task management)
    - commit-message-guide.mdc (git workflow standards)
    
    Removed over-engineered rules following best practices.
