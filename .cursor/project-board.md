# Portfolio Project Board

## To Do

- [002] Monorepo Tooling Selection
  - due: 2025-07-02
  - tags: [setup, tooling, architecture]
  - priority: high
    ```md
    Research and select appropriate monorepo tooling for the Portfolio project.
    **DECISION NEEDED**: Choose between:
    - Yarn Workspaces + Changesets (recommended in guide)
    - Nx (full monorepo toolkit with build optimization)
    - Turborepo (fast build system)
    - Lerna (traditional monorepo management)
    
    Evaluate based on: build optimization, dependency management, versioning needs,and development workflow. Document decision rationale.
    ```

- [003] Initialize Monorepo Structure
  - due: 2025-07-02
  - tags: [setup, tooling, architecture]
  - priority: high
    ```md
    Set up the basic monorepo structure with proper workspace configuration.
    Create packages directory, configure package.json workspaces, and establish
    build scripts for the monorepo tooling selected in previous task.
    
    Target structure: apps/frontend, apps/backend, packages/shared, packages/types,
    packages/config, tools/docker, tools/database.
    ```

- [004] Environment Variable Strategy Decision
  - due: 2025-07-02
  - tags: [docker, environment, security]
  - priority: high
    ```md
    **DECISION NEEDED**: Choose environment variable strategy for Docker Compose.
    Current: Explicit mapping with defaults (${VAR:-default})
    
    Options:
    1. Keep current (explicit, secure, verbose)
    2. Use env_file directive (automatic, less explicit)  
    3. Hybrid approach (critical vars explicit, convenience vars from file)
    4. External secrets (production-grade, complex)
    
    Consider development ease vs production security. Document choice rationale.
    ```

  - tags: [tooling, code-quality, standards]
  - priority: medium
    ```md
    Configure ESLint and Prettier at the monorepo root level to ensure
    consistent code formatting and linting across all packages. Set up
    shared configurations that can be extended by individual packages.
